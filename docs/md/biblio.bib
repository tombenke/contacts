summary="Domain Driven Design is a vision and approach for dealing with highly
complex domains that is based on making the domain itself the main
focus of the project, and maintaining a software model that reflects
a deep understanding of the domain. This book is a short,
quickly-readable summary and introduction to the fundamentals of DDD;
it does not introduce any new concepts; it attempts to concisely
summarize the essence of what DDD is, drawing mostly Eric Evans'
original book, as well other sources since published such as Jimmy
Nilsson's Applying Domain Driven Design, and various DDD discussion
forums. The main topics covered in the book include: Building Domain
Knowledge, The Ubiquitous Language, Model Driven Design, Refactoring
Toward Deeper Insight, and Preserving Model Integrity. Also included
is an interview with Eric Evans on Domain Driven Design today."

Summary="A really good web development framework anticipates your needs.
jQuery does more-it practically reads your mind. Developers fall in
love with this JavaScript library the moment they see 20 lines of
code reduced to three. jQuery is concise and readable. jQuery in
Action, Second Edition is a fast-paced introduction and guide. It
shows you how to traverse HTML documents, handle events, perform
animations, and add Ajax to your web pages. The book's unique 'lab
pages' anchor the explanation of each new concept in a practical
example. You'll learn how jQuery interacts with other tools and
frameworks and how to build jQuery plugins. This revised and expanded
second edition includes even more lab pages than before, along with
numerous examples that show the latest best practices developed by
the jQuery community. It provides full coverage of jQuery 1.4, along
with a deeper look at the ever-expanding world of jQuery plug-ins.
This book requires some knowledge of JavaScript and Ajax but no
previous experience with jQuery."

simplifies storage of large data sets and offers an alternative to
the complexity of MySQL or SQL Server. CouchDB in Action is a guide
for developers building and managing high-volume data-driven

databases, the book explores CouchDB's features from installation to
deployment using practical examples and use cases. Early chapters
demonstrate setting up a CouchDB database, and how to view, query,
sort, and filter data. Later in the book, readers will learn how
CouchDB leverages MapReduce, techniques for data replication to avoid
downtime, and reporting styles to present large data sets."

Summary="This hands-on book introduces you to Apache CouchDB, a
document-oriented database that offers a different way to model your
data. CouchDB is a schema-free database, designed to work with
applications that handle commonplace information such as contacts,
invoices, and receipts -- information that's easier to access as
self-contained documents, rather than as records in a relational
database. In CouchDB: The Definitive Guide, three of the core
developers of this database gently explain how to work with CouchDB,
using clear and practical scenarios. Each chapter showcases key
features, such as simple document CRUD (create, read, update,
delete), advanced MapReduce, and deployment tuning for performance
and reliability. With this book, you will: Understand the basics of
document-based storage and manipulation Learn how CouchDB's RESTful
nature lets you interact with it by sending HTTP requests and
receiving HTTP responses Model data as self-contained JSON documents
Manage basic document CRUD Handle evolving data naturally Query and
aggregate data in CouchDB using MapReduce views Replicate data
between nodes Carry out deployment tuning for performance and
reliability Why complicate your recordkeeping by using a cumbersome
relational database, when you can save your data as self-contained
documents with CouchDB? Learn how CouchDB is ideal for high volume,
distributed applications, and useful as an application framework on
its own, with CouchDB: The Definitive Guide. It's the only book that
covers this database."

Web, and the CouchDB document-oriented database lets you store
location data and perform complex queries on it quickly. You'll learn
how to get started with these tools, and then use them together to
build an example project called MapChat, using HTML and JavaScript

Edition="Paperback",
Summary="Ajax and REST Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach will serve all of
your Ajax needs, by providing adaptable solutions for common tasks
you'll want to implement on web sites using the next generation of
Ajax and REST techniques. As a JavaScript developer, your time is
precious, so you'll want to solve problems that present themselves in
your work as quickly as possible. You can pick up the code provided
in this book, adapt it, or plug it straight into your own
applications. The book mainly focuses on illustrating and explaining
how to build applications that use JavaScript, Ajax, and REST Web
Services, along with some user interface issues. Specifically, the
following topics are covered: implementing JavaScript unit tests;
explaining the intent of Dynamic Languages, Web Services and SOA;
defining and implementing contracts using REST; understanding why
JavaScript Functions have state; implementing JavaScript 'Generics',
which are a mixture between real Generics and a replacement
algorithm; using code blocks; using functions to make decisions;
understanding the difference of JavaScript code that behaves like a
value type or a reference type; implementing proxies, delegates,
mixins, and overloaded functions; implementing a complete Ajax and
Web Service architecture; defining a Web Service using REST; handling
large or slow or real-time data sets; implementing shopping cart type
architectures; and solving the back button problem using Ajax. Having
read this book you will learn how to modularize your web application
by decoupling the client from the server. The decoupling allows a
client developer to focus on writing the best JavaScript and Ajax
code, and a server developer to write the best business and data
objects."
