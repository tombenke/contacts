# Introduction

The Contacts manager application is a simple tool, 
that is able to track personal contact data.


This document helps you to use the application.

## Log-in / Log-out

When you open the URL of the application, first the login screen appears.

Here you have to add your username and password, then click on the "__Login__" button.
If the credentials are correct, the application starts loading, then the contacts
browser panel appears.

If you leave your workplace, you may want to log-out from the application, to
prevent unauthorized people to access the data.
In such cases you can log-out from the program, using the "__Sign-out__" link at
the top-right corner of the page, as you see on the figure below.
